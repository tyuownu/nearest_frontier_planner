This package should be used with `move_base`, a robot (real robot, `stage` or `gazebo`) and a mapping 
algorithm(like: [gmapping](https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping),[cartographer](https://github.com/googlecartographer/cartographer) or [icp](https://github.com/tyuownu/mrpt_slam)).

## Example

The example show how to use the package, you need to install the packages below:

1. [navigation(branch: develop1.5)](https://github.com/tyuownu/navigation)
2. [mrpt_slam(branch: develop1.5)](https://github.com/tyuownu/mrpt_slam)
3. [navigation_tutorials(branch: develop1.5)](https://github.com/tyuownu/navigation_tutorials)

``` bash
roslaunch navigation_stage move_base_icpslam_5cm.launch
roslaunch nearest_frontier_planner nearest_frontier_planner.launch
rosservice call /StartExploration
```
